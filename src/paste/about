**** About ****

safepaste is a security-conscious paste service for sharing private, encrypted
data. All encryption is done client-side and it's impossible for the server,
admin, or anyone without your 256 bit key to view the paste. All pastes are
encrypted using AES-256.

**** Features ****

* AES-256 with random 256 bit secret keys
* Always over HTTPS
* Optional "burn after reading"
* Always free and open source

**** Burn after reading ****

When selected, "burn after reading" will ensure that only one person will ever
read your paste. The paste will live for the default length of one day, but
will be atomically destroyed should anyone view it. Use this to ensure your
paste doesn't mingle after it's been read.

**** How it works ****

Upon pasting, your browser will generate a random 256 bit secret key. Using
that key, and AES-256, your paste is encrypted before it's sent to the server.
The server will reply with a 64 bit identifier for your paste; from there, you
share your paste by linking to the encrypted data and specifying your secret
key as the hash in the URL.

Here's a breakdown of an example link:

https://safepaste.org/f1a8f535#31bcdb56b77528a3c1b540bc460ed07d5b74fcf65eb91733bc4d10884e764caf

Paste ID: f1a8f535
Secret key (hash): 31bcdb56b77528a3c1b540bc460ed07d5b74fcf65eb91733bc4d10884e764caf

The hash section of the URL, after the #, is never sent to the server; it's
used only by the browser and safepaste takes advantage of that to store the
secret key. Note, your paste is unreadable to anyone without that secret key.
As soon as you share the link containing that key, however, anyone who sees it
can read your paste. Share your links cautiously.

**** Command-line tool ****

There is a command line tool for uploading and downloading pastes, written in
bash, included in the repo. See the link below.

**** Rate limiting ****

Due to the limited resources of the current server, and in hopes of minimizing
spam, there is a limit to the number of pastes which can be made every 12
hours.
